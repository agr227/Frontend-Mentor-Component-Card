# Frontend-Mentor-Component-Card
Component card practice HTML from the Frontend Mentor website.
First attemot creating a profile card style component using CSS.
I had some issues spacing internally within the card and getting the sizing similar to the example they had given.
I wanted to add some more reactive pieces to it (i.e. links to profile, hover properties, etc) but my time is limited right now.
Always down for feedback on how I should improve my work or my coding in general!
